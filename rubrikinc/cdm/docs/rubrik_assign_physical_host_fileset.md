# rubrik_assign_physical_host_fileset   

Assign a fileset to a Linux, Unix or Windows machine. If you have multiple filesets with identical names, you will need to populate the filesets properties to find a specific match. Filesets with identical names and properties are not supported.

`Requirement: Rubrik Python SDK (pip install rubrik_cdm)`

# Example

```yaml
- rubrik_assign_physical_host_fileset:
    hostname: 'ansible-tower'
    fileset_name: 'all-files'
    operating_system: Linux
    sla_name: 'Gold'
```

## Common

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Default |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| node_ip   | The DNS hostname or IP address of the Rubrik cluster. By defeault, the module will attempt to read this value from the rubrik_cdm_node_ip environment variable. If this environment variable is not present it will need to be manually specified here or in the `provider' parameter.                    |         |
| password  | The password used to authenticate the connection to the Rubrik cluster. By defeault, the module will attempt to read this value from the rubrik_cdm_password environment variable. If this environment variable is not present it will need to be manually specified here or in the `provider' parameter. |         |
| username  | The username used to authenticate the connection to the Rubrik cluster. By defeault, the module will attempt to read this value from the rubrik_cdm_username environment variable. If this environment variable is not present it will need to be manually specified here or in the `provider' parameter. |         |
| api_token | The api token used to authenticate the connection to the Rubrik cluster. By defeault, the module will attempt to read this value from the rubrik_cdm_token environment variable. If this environment variable is not present it will need to be manually specified here or in the `provider' parameter.   |         |
| provider  | Convenience method that allows all connection arguments (`node_ip', `username', `password') to be passed as a dict object. By default, the module will attempt to read these parameters from the rubrik_cdm_node_ip, rubrik_cdm_username, and rubrik_cdm_password environment variables.                  |         |

| Note: The `username` and `password` must be supplied together and may not be provided if the `api_token` variable is present|
